# SOLID
# Introduction

The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.These five principles help us understand the need for certain design patterns and software architecture in general. So I believe that it is a topic that every developer should learn.
